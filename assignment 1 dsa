Assignment 1: 

Data set: GapMinder Data. 

Research question: Is a fertility rate associated with a number of breast cancer cases?

Items included in the CodeBook: 

for fertility rate: 

Children per woman (total fertility)
Children per woman (total fertility), with projections

for breast cancer: 

Breast cancer, deaths per 100,000 women
Breast cancer, new cases per 100,000 women
Breast cancer, number of female deaths
Breast cancer, number of new female cases

Literature Review:

From original source: http://ww5.komen.org/KomenPerspectives/Does-pregnancy-affect-breast-cancer-risk-and-survival-.html

The more children a woman has given birth to, the lower her risk of breast cancer tends to be. Women who have never given birth have a slightly higher risk of breast cancer compared to women who have had more than one child.

The hypothesis to explore using GapMinder data set: the higher fertility rate, the lower risk of breast cancer.
